# nodets

## Synopsis

I've been stepping outside of my node.js comfort zone lately and trying different tools and configurations. With this one I wanted to see how far I can get using typescript and Docker. Adding jest soon.

The plan is to build out a useful little server that provides some type of value. Probably static lookups like states/countries or temp/currency conversions. We'll see what happens. :-)

## Code Example

## Motivation

Playing around with typescript && docker in a node application.
